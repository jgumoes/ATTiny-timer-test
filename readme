# ATTiny85 timer test

## What

a little test to play with the timers on ATTiny85. Timer 0 uses an interrupt to create long pulses. Timer 1 checks compare flags for short pulses. Both toggle/set arbitrary pins but don't have to (neither is tied to an output compare pin). On github to save it for future reference.

## Why

This is for another project to use an ATTiny to compensate for cheap decoder quirks, mostly getting stuck on an incomplete cycle. The idea is to have incomplete cycles expire so they don't screw with the user input

## results

timer0 (the slow one) has an interval of about 104.6 mS. multiplying with the interrupt should be useful for long async delays.

timer1 (the fast one) has pulse width of 59 uS, or 8 kHz. should be useful for output pulses.
